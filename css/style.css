  that using percent to font-size the body element helps users scale text
  consistently on any device, and then using em to size all child elements keeps
  it mobile-friendly but still scalable across a smaller, more consistent
  range than percent only. the base % of 62.5 also translates to 1em = 10pt,
  1.1em = 11 pt, 1.2 em = 12 pt etc. in the children. */
